# Why is this here>
These fonts were copied from the Figlet library. I'm including them here because the version of the library I downloaded onto my Raspberry Pi zero didn't include most of the fonts. I may remove this if I figure out a better solution, but I want to be able to test stuff quickly and easily, so this will work for now.
