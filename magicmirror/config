# Each entry in this file contains the information needed to launch a cron job, 
# with the exception of the 'environment' entry. For all other entries, the 
# following are required:
#
#   - timing: how often do you want the job to run? This uses the crontab
#           format for specifying a schedule. If you're unfamiliar with this,
#           here are some resources:
#               https://crontab.guru/
#               https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/cron/crontab.5.en.html
# 
#   - box_column: each widget takes up a rectangular section of the screen. This
#           value specifies the X VALUE of the UPPER LEFT CORNER of that
#           rectangle. Because this is all happening with text in the terminal,
#           the units are COLUMNS indexed from zero.
#
#   - box_row: each widget takes up a rectangular section of the screen. This
#           value specifies the Y VALUE of the UPPER LEFT CORNER of that
#           rectangle. Because this is all happening with text in the terminal,
#           the units are ROWS indexed from zero.
#
#   - box_width: each widget takes up a rectangular section of the screen. This
#           value specifies the WIDTH of that box in COLUMNS
#
#   - box_height: each widget takes up a rectangular section of the screen. This
#           value specifies the HEIGHT of that box IN ROWS
#
#   - command: the command that we want cron to run. 
#           This command should return a block of text, with each line separated
#           by a newline. The block of text will be inserted into the term.txt
#           file.
#           - A few notes:
#               - I'm setting SHELL to /bin/bash, so the command will be 
#                 interpreted by bash (the default is /bin/sh, but I think more
#                 people are familiar with bash, and I want this to be friendly
#                 to hack).
#               - Percent signs (%) will be interpreted as newlines unless you
#                 escape them with a backslash (blame cron, not me)
#
# There is also the special 'environment' entry.
# Stuff you put in there will more or less be environment variables as far as 
# cron is concerned. 
#
#
