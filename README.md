# magic-mirror-zero
The purpose of this project is to create some lightweight code that will duplicate some of the functionality of existing magic mirror software, but without as much overhead.
The [most popular magic mirror software](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) requires a raspberry pi 3 running the full desktop version of Raspberry Pi OS, as well as Electron. That seems like overkill for a project that's displaying a small amount of information on a screen. 
This version will:
- run on a raspberry pi zero
- require only Raspberry Pi OS lite
As a trade off, this will have a largely text based display paradigm, with only crude graphics available.
